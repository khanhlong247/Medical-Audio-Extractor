He is being treated for eczema, but we think it may be something linked to nervous system. Last week, he described the pain over both knees as like being covered in these. he has had bypass surgery, so takes some medication. He is well in himself except for this rash, which is causing a lot of distress. He had shingles several years ago, so I thought it might be related. We are looking for a diagnosis, so he can start to get better. Thank you.</s>",
